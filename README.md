This program is made by Nicoline Due Smedegaard, Cathrine Dybro and Mathias Tvilling. 
We have named the program "What is your mood?". It makes use of the Giphy search API, and essentially picks a GIF from 25 available and displays it. The keyword for the search is mood, and the query return 25 GIFs. We spend a lot of time looking through different API's, and settled on Giphy because of it being very easy to use. Through searching different API's, we practiced reading the JSON they return, and this really helped the understanding when we got to coding.
