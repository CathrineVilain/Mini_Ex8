This program is made by Nicoline Due Smedegaard, Cathrine Dybro and Mathias Tvilling. 
We have named the program "What is your mood?". It makes use of the Giphy search API, and essentially picks a GIF from 25 available and displays it. The keyword for the search is mood, and the query return 25 GIFs. We spent a lot of time looking through different API's, and settled on Giphy because of it being very easy to use. Through searching different API's, we practiced reading the JSON they return, and this really helped the understanding when we got to coding. 

For me the process started with understanding what an API actually is. I found out that an API is a really useful way to store and retrieve data. We decided to use Giphys API. They have chosen to make their API easily accesible to users which I think is cool. It is very easy to change and apply their API to your own work. In order to custom/use their API you have to create a user on giphy, then you can select which category you want the API to filter data through. We chose "mood". You can also choose how many gifs you want to store in your data file. We chose 25, because we didn't feel that we needed that many gifs. Once we got the API key we downloaded the data. To recap; we got the API to filter/narrow down it's data through the category "mood". Then we got it to narrow down the data by only choosing 25 gifs. This is only one example and I'm sure that other API's work differently. 

My question is; "If every webpage/app use different API's, then is it even possible to aquire unbiased/objective data?". To further explain; When you search the web the results are always filtered in some sort of way. The webpage actively choses how they want their data to be accessed. Results are always filtered in some way. Data can forexample be filtered by "most popular", "most recent" etc. So if you want to research a subject without a bias is it actually impossible?
