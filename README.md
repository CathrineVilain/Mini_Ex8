This program is made by Nicoline Due Smedegaard, Cathrine Dybro and Mathias Tvilling. 
We have named the program "What is your mood?". It makes use of the Giphy search API, and essentially picks a GIF from 25 available and displays it. The keyword for the search is mood, and the query return 25 GIFs. We spend a lot of time looking through different API's, and settled on Giphy because of it being very easy to use. Through searching different API's, we practiced reading the JSON they return, and this really helped the understanding when we got to coding. 


For me, the trick with API's is to be able to read the file that the query returns, but also just setting up the query, and building the URL is something I find to be a little confusing at first. I find it to be one of those things where you have to be on top of every little line and understand the structure completely in order to take something from it. As we worked with it, it became increasingly clear how the data was structured. Of course, the queries we made were very simple, and as such, the data return was not overly complex either - this made it easier, but since it was our first time using API's, I'm satisfied with achieving even basic knowledge of structure and function, which I think I obtained through this mini_ex.


A question for future answering for me would definitely be something regarding the limitations of web API's, especially when the data we are querying is somewhat sensitive (personal information on people). In the future, I would love to work with API's from Twitter, Facebook and the like, to explore this further. I think the way these companies go about limiting, monetizing and using their data through API's says a lot about the way they view the discussion of authorship. When Twitter releases personal data through their API, they are in some ways treating it like a business property, instead of personal data - I think this is something which will become very relevant given the introduction of stricter personal data laws.
